<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gsurica</h1>

<p> I've been working with javascript for a while, more exact almost a year. I have more advanced experiences with html and css. I'm addicted to logic challenges like Codewars, Frontend-mentor and Css-battle, my focus being Codewars. </P>

<p> about my personal life? so... I'm a Magic player, A pokemon TCG player and a Lol player, yeah... ðŸ¥² 
    but, after this, i'm a self proclaimed rock singer. And for the final point, i'm a just regular everyday normal guy. ðŸŽµ;
